## Introduction
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 
One approach that helped Cyclistic marketing team in building general awareness was by creating flexibility of pricing plans: Single-ride passes, full-day passes and annual membership. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders while customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
